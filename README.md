# Practice Better Streamlines Practice Management: Save Time, Boost Client Care, Grow Your Revenue

Running a health and wellness practice shouldn't mean drowning in paperwork. Yet here you are, spending six hours a week just taking notes after sessions, juggling five different apps for scheduling and billing, and wondering when you'll actually have time to help people get healthier.

Practice Better understands this frustration because it was built by someone who lived it. What started as one holistic nutritionist's solution to her own administrative nightmare has become the go-to platform for over 50,000 wellness practitioners worldwide.

## What Makes Practice Better Different

Most practice management software gives you a toolbox of separate features that don't quite talk to each other. Practice Better takes a different approach—everything works together in one smooth workflow.

The platform handles your scheduling, client communication, billing, telehealth sessions, charting, and even course creation. But the real magic happens in how these pieces connect. Book an appointment, and the system automatically sends reminders, preps intake forms, and sets up your telehealth room. Finish a session, and your AI assistant has already drafted the notes.

This isn't just convenient. It's how you get your evenings back.

## The AI Charting Assistant That Actually Saves Time

Let's talk about the feature that's changing the game for practitioners: the AI Charting Assistant.

Practice Better became the first AI-powered EHR for wellness professionals back in December 2023, and the results speak for themselves. Practitioners report cutting their charting time in half—that's three hours back in your week, minimum.

Here's how it works: the AI records your telehealth sessions, Zoom calls, or even in-person appointments (just place your device between you and your client). While you're fully present with your patient, the AI is listening, transcribing, and organizing everything.

After the session, you get a complete summary in your preferred format—SOAP notes, bulleted outlines, or narrative paragraphs. The AI pulls out action items for both you and your client, so nothing falls through the cracks. You can even jump to specific moments in the recording if you need to reference something.

The first 600 minutes are free. After that, it's just $0.60 per hour of recording time. For context, that's about $6 per month if you're seeing 20 clients weekly.

Oh, and it's fully HIPAA-compliant, along with PIPEDA and GDPR standards. No client data trains the AI models—ever.

## All-In-One Platform Features

Practice Better consolidates what would normally require 8-10 different software subscriptions into a single platform.

**Scheduling & Appointments**  
Clients book directly through your custom link, seeing your real-time availability. The system handles reminders, allows self-rescheduling, and syncs with Google Calendar. No more email ping-pong trying to find a time that works.

**Client Portal**  
Your clients get their own secure space to access everything: appointment history, shared documents, health protocols, meal plans, messaging, and more. It's like giving them a personalized wellness hub that works on any device.

**Telehealth**  
Built-in HIPAA-compliant video sessions mean you don't need a Zoom subscription (though Zoom integration is available too). Group sessions, screen sharing, and session recording all included.

**Billing & Payments**  
Practice Better Payments handles invoicing, payment processing, and even payment plans. You can also generate superbills for insurance reimbursement. Everything processes within the platform—no jumping to Stripe or Square.

**Forms & Intake**  
Create custom forms, waivers, and assessments that clients fill out electronically. Set them to auto-send before appointments or at specific intervals. All responses save directly to client records.

**Protocols & Programs**  
Build reusable treatment plans, lifestyle recommendations, and wellness protocols. Pull in supplements from Fullscript or WholeScripts, add meal plans from That Clean Life (which Practice Better acquired), and share everything through the client portal.

**Food & Lifestyle Journals**  
Clients track meals, water intake, exercise, sleep, and symptoms. The platform includes a database of 600,000+ foods and integrates with Apple Health, Fitbit, Garmin, and Oura for automatic data syncing.

**Messaging**  
Secure, HIPAA-compliant messaging keeps all client communication in one place. Send individual messages or group chats for program participants. No more scattered texts, emails, and DMs.

**Automations**  
Set up workflows that trigger automatically: send welcome emails when clients sign up, reminder sequences for appointments, or follow-up tasks after sessions. The system handles repetitive tasks while you sleep.

**Team Collaboration**  
The Team plan lets multiple practitioners share calendars, clients, and resources. Admin staff can manage scheduling on behalf of clinicians. Perfect for group practices or clinics.

## What Users Actually Say

Practice Better holds a 4.7 out of 5 star rating across major review platforms, with 95% positive reviews. Here's what real practitioners report:

**The Good:**  
Users consistently praise how Practice Better consolidates their entire workflow. One nutrition coach who's used the platform for five years said it "runs my entire business" and has "saved me hundreds of hours." She uses it for group programs, client communication, protocols, scheduling, and billing—things that previously required 10 different tools.

Many appreciate the flexibility. You can customize forms, note templates, and client protocols to match your specific practice style. The integrations with Fullscript, Zoom, Google Calendar, and payment processors get frequent mentions as major time-savers.

Client engagement features stand out too. The food journal with 600,000+ foods, automated appointment reminders, and the mobile app make it easy for clients to stay connected and accountable between sessions.

**The Challenges:**  
Some users mention the initial learning curve. While the platform is intuitive once you're up and running, setting everything up the way you want—calendars, automations, templates—takes time. Practice Better offers extensive video tutorials and training, but it's still an investment.

A few practitioners wish for message templates to handle repetitive client communications during onboarding. Others want more robust lab tracking features with visual trends over time.

Customer support gets mixed reviews. Many report helpful, responsive service, while others experienced delays getting technical issues resolved. Wait times for support calls can stretch to two weeks during busy periods.

The pricing increase in 2025 (all plans went up $10/month) disappointed some long-time users, particularly those on lower tiers who saw the jump from $25 to $35 monthly as steep for their small practices.

**Bottom Line:**  
Most practitioners say the platform is worth it despite any shortcomings. The all-in-one approach genuinely saves time and money compared to cobbling together multiple subscriptions. And the AI Charting Assistant has become a game-changer for those who've adopted it.

## Who Should Choose Practice Better

Practice Better works best for:

**Holistic Health Practitioners:** Nutritionists, dietitians, naturopaths, functional medicine doctors, and health coaches find the platform built specifically for their workflows. Features like food journals, supplement protocols, and meal plan integration make sense for wellness-focused practices.

**Virtual & Hybrid Practices:** If you see clients online or mix in-person and telehealth, Practice Better's native video platform and strong client portal give you everything needed to deliver great virtual care.

**Program & Course Creators:** The ability to build, sell, and deliver online courses and group programs sets Practice Better apart. You're not just managing appointments—you're building multiple revenue streams.

**Growing Practices:** The tiered pricing lets you start small and scale up. Begin with Starter at $35/month when you have just a few clients, then upgrade as your practice grows without switching platforms.

**Team-Based Clinics:** Multi-practitioner practices benefit from shared calendars, unified client management, and admin support features that keep everyone coordinated.

Practice Better might not be the best fit if you:
- Run an insurance-based practice (though insurance billing integration with Claim.MD is available)
- Need extensive lab tracking with detailed trend visualization
- Prefer separate best-of-breed tools over an all-in-one platform
- Work in a highly regulated specialty requiring very specific compliance features

**1+ million clients** receive care through the platform

**50% reduction** in time spent on charting and documentation (with AI Charting Assistant)

**6 hours/week** average time savings on post-session note-taking

**$13 million** in growth capital secured in November 2024 from CIBC Innovation Banking

Most practitioners are fully up and running within a week. Those with more complex needs—multiple service types, extensive protocols, team coordination—might invest 2-3 weeks in setup.

If you're switching from another EHR, Practice Better's Migration Concierge Service provides hands-on help with the file transfer process and account setup, so your practice keeps running smoothly during the transition.

## Why Practice Better Works

At its core, Practice Better solves a simple problem: health and wellness practitioners shouldn't spend more time on admin work than actually helping people.

The platform was created by someone who experienced that frustration firsthand. As her nutrition practice grew, each new client added hours of scheduling emails, invoice follow-ups, and manual note-taking. She needed to scale without burning out.

That origin story shows in how Practice Better is designed. It's not about cramming in every possible feature—it's about making sure the features you actually need work together seamlessly. Book an appointment and the system handles reminders. Finish a session and the AI drafts your notes. Send a protocol and clients can access it instantly on their phones.

This integration is what users say saves them the most time. Not individual features, but how those features connect to create a smooth workflow.

## The Bottom Line

Practice Better has become the leading all-in-one EHR for wellness professionals because it actually delivers on the promise of simplifying practice management.

You get professional scheduling, HIPAA-compliant telehealth, integrated billing, intelligent charting, client engagement tools, and program creation all in one platform. The AI Charting Assistant alone can save you 3+ hours weekly, and many practitioners report reclaiming entire evenings once spent on paperwork.

Starting at $35/month for solo practitioners (or free for students), Practice Better costs less than most practitioners spend on separate scheduling, billing, and video conferencing tools—and it does a whole lot more.

The platform isn't perfect. Setup takes some effort, and you'll need to invest time learning the system. But thousands of practitioners have made that investment and come out the other side with thriving practices that give them work-life balance.

If you're spending too many hours on admin work and not enough time with clients, Practice Better is worth exploring.
